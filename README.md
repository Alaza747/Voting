# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a voting project. It comes with a solidity contract where one can create his/her own contract with answer options, a complete full suite test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
